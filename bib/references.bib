	abstract = {Artificial intelligence by principle is developed to assist but also support decision making processes. In our study, we explore how information retrieved from social media can assist decision-making processes for new product development (NPD). We focus on consumers’ emotions that are expressed through social media and analyse the variations of their sentiments in all the stages of NPD. We collect data from Twitter that reveal consumers’ appreciation of aspects of the design of a newly launched model of an innovative automotive company. We adopt the sensemaking approach coupled with the use of fuzzy logic for text mining. This combinatory methodological approach enables us to retrieve consensus from the data and to explore the variations of sentiments of the customers about the product and define the polarity of these emotions for each of the NPD stages. The analysis identifies sensemaking patterns in Twitter data and explains the NPD process and the associated steps where the social interactions from customers can have an iterative role. We conclude the paper by outlining an agenda for future research in the NPD process and the role of the customer opinion through sensemaking mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Rapid and accurate identification of customers preferences on specification combinations is critical to the development of competitive electric vehicles. Both conscious and subconscious preferences of customers are embedded in the big sales data of electric vehicles. Based on the big sales data of electric vehicles in the Chinese market in 2021, this paper provides a novel customer preference mining approach for supporting design decision-making of electric vehicles. Specifications and sales numbers of electric vehicles are collected and analyzed for customers preferences information mining. Based on the relationship between specifications and components, mutation and reproduction probabilities of electric vehicle components are calculated for meeting customers’ diversified preferences on specification combinations. Recommendations of design decision-making for enhancing product adaptability are made through components clustering based on the mutation and reproduction probabilities of electric vehicle components. Similarities and differences between the recommended design and current design of electric vehicles are investigated to illustrate the rationality of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10\% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV.},

	abstract = {New energy vehicles (NEVs) such as electronic cars represent a major trend in the automobile industry, where most their exterior designs still follow those of convention fuelled vehicles (FVs). It is important to investigate whether NEV users have unique requirements that differ from those of traditional users. Kansei engineering is a practical tool for perceptual demand analysis. However, the conventional method requires questionnaires or surveys to perform limited data collection. In this study, we utilised massive internet data to collect user Kansei requirements for NEV exterior design. The Scrapy crawler was adopted for data collection and a bidirectional long short-term memory, conditional random field, and multilayer perceptron framework was developed for text mining. To quantify design features and Kansei image scores, a hybrid Apriori + structural equation model (SEM) system is proposed, where the data-driven Apriori algorithm can explore the hidden relationships in big user generated comments, while the SEM model captures the users’ behaviour and decision procedure so that to provide interpretable results. In addition, the association rules mined from user comments by Apriori can facilitate the specification of a complicated SEM model, substantially reducing the modelling and calibration effort. Goodness-of-fit results suggest that the proposed model outperforms conventional models. A case study on 1805 automobiles, 287 brands, and 369105 comments was conducted and the results suggest that some design features that would increase the Kansei image scores for conventional FVs may have the opposite effect on NEVs. Discussions on engineering and managerial insights are presented and the discovered rules and relationships are employed to develop a design-aided system.},

	abstract = {Individuals’ attention and sentiment are the keys to adopting electric vehicles (EVs). Traditional questionnaires and interviews cannot fully and accurately reflect the attention and sentiments. Social media interactions can provide a new data-driven perspective to explore the sentiment toward EVs. This study uses data from public posts on Weibo to investigate intersectionality in EV - sentiment and attention as per user, gender and region. On a 1,149,243-text corpus extracted from the Weibo posts, a computational social science methodology was employed with a mixed-method of deep learning and topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algo­ rithm. Results showed that attention toward EVs mainly comes from official users rather than individual users (IUs), and IUs’ attention is closely linked with EV policy change. Additionally, the attention level and growth rate toward EVs vary across regions and men pay more attention to EVs. There exist significant differences in both positive and negative sentiment driving factors across genders. This study facilitates to EVs’ policy-making and strategy in China and other countries.},

	abstract = {Understanding public perception of electric vehicles (EVs) is imperative for increasing EV adoption, which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and global warming. While most existing research characterizes public perception of EV in the context of surveys, questionnaires, or interviews, our study leverages Reddit online social network (OSN) data to capture EV public perception at a much larger scale. We have collected 3,437,917 Reddit posts (including 274,979 submissions and 3,162,938 comments) between January 2011 and December 2020 relevant to EVs and analyzed them along several axes to understand how EVs are perceived by the public on Reddit through the following research questions: (1) What EV-related topics have been discussed by Reddit users? Whether/how Reddit users’ interest in different topics has changed during 2011–2020? (2) What sentiment do Reddit users hold towards EVs? Whether public sentiment on Reddit has shifted over the past 10 years? (3) Whether/how do various Reddit communities (i.e., subreddits) have different perceptions of EVs? Our analysis evinces the potential of utilizing a large-scale OSN dataset for demonstrating a much wider spectrum of topics that the public is interested in than previous studies show, reveals fringe communities including r/conspiracy have many (controversial) discussions on EVs, especially on the environmental impacts of EVs, and one political community (r/The\_Donald) has similar patterns with fringe communities in both sentiment and topic aspects. By answering these research questions, we aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the public perception of EVs in the past decade.},
