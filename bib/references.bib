	abstract = {Conventionally, a market research and strategy for a product depends on the interviews and an explicit cluster/society to identify the customer’s needs. Customer-created information (CCI), such as call-center data, online reviews, and social media posts, provides an opportunity to recognize the customer’s needs more efficiently. Moreover, developed conventional approaches are not compatible with large CCI datasets because most of the CCI-contents are repetitive and uninformative. In this paper, a machine learning approach for identifying the customer needs from the CCI dataset is proposed and its performance is evaluated for targeting and recommending a new product for project management. After the identification of the needs of the customer, information can be used to develop a market strategy, new product launching, brand positioning and much more long/short term planning.},

	abstract = {Creating product ecosystems has been one of the strategic ways to enhance user experience and business advantages. Among many, customer needs analysis for product ecosystems is one of the most challenging tasks in creating a successful product ecosystem from both the perspectives of marketing research and product development. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning approach to customer needs analysis for product ecosystems by examining a large amount of online user-generated product reviews within a product ecosystem. First, we filtered out uninformative reviews from the informative reviews using a fastText technique. Then, we extract a variety of topics with regard to customer needs using a topic modeling technique named latent Dirichlet allocation. In addition, we applied a rule-based sentiment analysis method to predict not only the sentiment of the reviews but also their sentiment intensity values. Finally, we categorized customer needs related to different topics extracted using an analytic Kano model based on the dissatisfaction-satisfaction pair from the sentiment analysis. A case example of the Amazon product ecosystem was used to illustrate the potential and feasibility of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence by principle is developed to assist but also support decision making processes. In our study, we explore how information retrieved from social media can assist decision-making processes for new product development (NPD). We focus on consumers’ emotions that are expressed through social media and analyse the variations of their sentiments in all the stages of NPD. We collect data from Twitter that reveal consumers’ appreciation of aspects of the design of a newly launched model of an innovative automotive company. We adopt the sensemaking approach coupled with the use of fuzzy logic for text mining. This combinatory methodological approach enables us to retrieve consensus from the data and to explore the variations of sentiments of the customers about the product and define the polarity of these emotions for each of the NPD stages. The analysis identifies sensemaking patterns in Twitter data and explains the NPD process and the associated steps where the social interactions from customers can have an iterative role. We conclude the paper by outlining an agenda for future research in the NPD process and the role of the customer opinion through sensemaking mechanisms.},

Both conscious and subconscious preferences of customers are embedded in the big sales data of electric vehicles. Based on the big sales data of electric vehicles in the Chinese market in 2021, this paper provides a novel customer preference mining approach for supporting design decision-making of electric vehicles. Specifications and sales numbers of electric vehicles are collected and analyzed for customers preferences information mining. Based on the relationship between specifications and components, mutation and reproduction probabilities of electric vehicle components are calculated for meeting customers’ diversified preferences on specification combinations. Recommendations of design decision-making for enhancing product adaptability are made through components clustering based on the mutation and reproduction probabilities of electric vehicle components. Similarities and differences between the recommended design and current design of electric vehicles are investigated to illustrate the rationality of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Today, climate change due to global warming is a significant concern to all of us. India's rate of greenhouse gas emissions is increasing day by day, placing India in the top ten emitters in the world. Air pollution is one of the significant contributors to the greenhouse effect. Transportation contributes about 10\% of the air pollution in India. The Indian government is taking steps to reduce air pollution by encouraging the use of electric vehicles. But, success depends on consumer's sentiment, perception and understanding towards Electric Vehicles (EV). This case study tried to capture the feeling, attitude, and emotions of Indian consumers' towards electric vehicles. The main objective of this study was to extract opinions valuable to prospective buyers (to know what is best for them), marketers (for determining what features should be advertised) and manufacturers (for deciding what features should be improved) using Deep Learning techniques (e.g Doc2Vec Algorithm, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)). Due to the very nature of social media data, big data platform was chosen to analyze the sentiment towards EV. Deep Learning based techniques were preferred over traditional machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Logistic regression and Decision tree, etc.) due to its superior text mining capabilities. Two years data (2016 to 2018) were collected from different social media platform for this case study. The results showed the efficiency of deep learning algorithms and found CNN yield better results in-compare to others. The proposed optimal model will help consumers, designers and manufacturers in their decision-making capabilities to choose, design and manufacture EV.},

	abstract = {Understanding public perception of electric vehicles (EVs) is imperative for increasing EV adoption, which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby mitigating climate change and global warming. While most existing research characterizes public perception of EV in the context of surveys, questionnaires, or interviews, our study leverages Reddit online social network (OSN) data to capture EV public perception at a much larger scale. We have collected 3,437,917 Reddit posts (including 274,979 submissions and 3,162,938 comments) between January 2011 and December 2020 relevant to EVs and analyzed them along several axes to understand how EVs are perceived by the public on Reddit through the following research questions: (1) What EV-related topics have been discussed by Reddit users? Whether/how Reddit users’ interest in different topics has changed during 2011–2020? (2) What sentiment do Reddit users hold towards EVs? Whether public sentiment on Reddit has shifted over the past 10 years? (3) Whether/how do various Reddit communities (i.e., subreddits) have different perceptions of EVs? Our analysis evinces the potential of utilizing a large-scale OSN dataset for demonstrating a much wider spectrum of topics that the public is interested in than previous studies show, reveals fringe communities including r/conspiracy have many (controversial) discussions on EVs, especially on the environmental impacts of EVs, and one political community (r/The\_Donald) has similar patterns with fringe communities in both sentiment and topic aspects. By answering these research questions, we aim to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the public perception of EVs in the past decade.},

	abstract = {Social media data have recently attracted considerable attention as an emerging voice of the customer as it has rapidly become a channel for exchanging and storing customer-generated, large-scale, and unregulated voices about products. Although product planning studies using social media data have used systematic methods for product planning, their methods have limitations, such as the diﬃculty of identifying latent product features due to the use of only term-level analysis and insuﬃcient consideration of opportunity potential analysis of the identiﬁed features. Therefore, an opportunity mining approach is proposed in this study to identify product opportunities based on topic modeling and sentiment analysis of social media data. For a multifunctional product, this approach can identify latent product topics discussed by product customers in social media using topic modeling, thereby quantifying the importance of each product topic. Next, the satisfaction level of each product topic is evaluated using sentiment analysis. Finally, the opportunity value and improvement direction of each product topic from a customer-centered view are identiﬁed by an opportunity algorithm based on product topics’ importance and satisfaction. We expect that our approach for product planning will contribute to the systematic identiﬁcation of product opportunities from large-scale customer-generated social media data and will be used as a real-time monitoring tool for changing customer needs analysis in rapidly evolving product environments.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a spatial analysis of Electric Vehicle registrations across the local authorities of the United Kingdom during the early phase of market development. Spatial autocorrelation tests are applied in order to identify any spatial organisation in registrations rates and spatial regression models are specified to consider the effect of socioeconomic, household, and transport system characteristics over registrations. Specific attention is paid to the association between Electric Vehicle registrations and the presence of charging infrastructure to consider if registrations are affected by infrastructure in the immediate and intermediate vicinity. The results of the analysis suggest Electric Vehicle demand exhibits a moderate degree of spatial clustering, which indicates the emergence of lead and laggard markets, and that the spatial variation in Electric Vehicle uptake can be partially explained through other characteristics of the local authorities. Characteristics relating to education level, employment status, income level, population density, dwelling type, household size, car availability, and the presence of Hybrid Electric Vehicles are significant factors in explaining the rate of Electric Vehicle registrations. Moreover, the level of charge point infrastructure installed within a local authority is positively associated with EV demand. From a policy perspective, the results reported in this paper indicate that local conditions are likely to be important in the rate of Electric Vehicle adoption, which may be of use when considering the development of geographically targeted interventions to accelerate Electric Vehicle demand.},

Scrutinizing words and phrases categorizes them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The significance of sentiment analysis lies in its capacity to derive valuable insights from extensive textual data, empowering businesses to grasp customer sentiments, make informed choices, and enhance their offerings. For the further advancement of sentiment analysis, gaining a deep understanding of its algorithms, applications, current performance, and challenges is imperative. Therefore, in this extensive survey, we began exploring the vast array of application domains for sentiment analysis, scrutinizing them within the context of existing research. We then delved into prevalent pre-processing techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics to enhance comprehension. We also explored Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Models and Pre-trained models in sentiment analysis, providing insights into their advantages and drawbacks. Subsequently, we precisely reviewed the experimental results and limitations of recent state-ofthe-art articles. Finally, we discussed the diverse challenges encountered in sentiment analysis and proposed future research directions to mitigate these concerns.
